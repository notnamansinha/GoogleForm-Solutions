# AI-Powered Google Forms Auto-Answer Extension

This project will build a Chrome extension to automatically answer Google Forms multiple-choice questions using the Gemini API. The extension will read the questions from the form, send them to Gemini for the correct answers, and then auto-select the determined options on the page.

## Proposed Changes

### Extension setup
These files set up the basic structure of the extension.

#### [NEW] manifest.json
Standard Manifest V3 with permissions for `activeTab`, `storage`, and `scripting`. Host permissions set to `https://docs.google.com/forms/*`.

#### [NEW] popup.html
The UI for the extension containing an API key input, an "Answer Form" button, and a status display.

#### [NEW] popup.js
Handles user interaction in the popup, saves/loads the API key to/from `chrome.storage.local`, and sends a message to the content script when the "Answer" button is clicked.

#### [NEW] styles.css
Styling for the popup UI and the visual indicator (highlighting) for auto-selected answers on the form.

### Content Script and Logic
These files run in the context of the Google Form page and interact with the Gemini API.

#### [NEW] content.js
The main content script injected into Google Forms. Responsible for:
1. Scraping the DOM for MCQ questions and options.
2. Listening for messages from the popup.
3. Sending scraped data to the Gemini integration service.
4. Locating and clicking the correct answer elements based on Gemini's response.
5. Highlighting (or adding visual indicators to) the selected answers.
6. Handling edge cases like dynamically loaded forms (using `MutationObserver`).

#### [NEW] geminiService.js
A separate script/module mapping questions to prompts, calling the `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent` endpoint, and returning structured answers.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. **Setup**: Load the extension as unpacked in `chrome://extensions/` by selecting the `c:\Users\Naman Sinha\Desktop\google extension\gemini-forms-helper` directory.
2. **Testing UI (Phase 1)**: Click the extension icon to verify the popup renders correctly. Enter a dummy API key and verify it saves.
3. **Scraping (Phase 2)**: Open a sample Google Form with MCQ questions, inspect the background/console logs to ensure `content.js` correctly identifies questions and options.
4. **Answering (End-to-End)**: Provide a real Gemini API Key, open a Google Form, click "Answer Form", and visually verify that the correct radio/checkboxes are clicked and highlighted.
